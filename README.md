# Authentication with Golang (Testing)
I'm learning about go and this time I want to learn about Authentication with Go
In this Code when you run
```
go run main.go
```
And you will check in Postman or [Thunder client] in VSCode please typing: 
```
localhost:8080/messages
```
And you will see Responses is Bad Authentication
You need to go HTTP Header
Check testbox and typing
```
Authorization : yourtoken
```
